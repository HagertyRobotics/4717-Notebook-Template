{We reached out to the Mayor of Oviedo, Megan Sladek, and invited her to Hagerty for a meeting.}
{As a team, we value getting members of our community involved and keeping them updated! We recently invited the mayor of Oviedo, Megan Sladek, to our build space for the second season in a row to share our love of STEM and FIRST with her. It was truly a wonderful experience to get involved with our local leadership and inform Mayor Sladek of our accomplishments, goals, and values as we continue to establish the importance of STEM in the Oviedo community.
