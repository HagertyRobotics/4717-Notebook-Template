{To get members of our community involved and keeping them updated on our progress as a team and continue to establish the importance of STEM in the Oviedo community.}
{On January 19th, we had the Mayor of Oviedo attend one of our meetings. At our meeting we were able to show off our robot from this season and last season and explain what the challenge for this year was. This was nice as we had the mayor over last year, 2022, and showed her the field and simple game mechanics. We were able to show off our unique tricycle design from last year and how we adapted it this year to make it use four wheels to better fit the challenge this season. One key point we made was that Oviedo is one of the largest centers for robotics in the state and how three robotics teams (FLL and FTC) from Oviedo made it to worlds last season. We hope to reach out later in the season to try to create a “Robotics Night” at a local park in order to gain interest and show off to the community how much fun robotics truly is. We briefly discussed our recent Used Battery Collection Drive and the Mayor noted that she did not know much about which batteries could and could not be recycled which just goes to show how our drive will help. Overall, the meeting was a success and we were able to show off how much STEM our community truly holds and hopefully we were able to make a lasting impact which can help grow FIRST and get more people into the program we truly love.
