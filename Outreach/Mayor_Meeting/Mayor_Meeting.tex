{We reached out to the Mayor of Oviedo, Megan Sladek, and invited her to Hagerty for a meeting.}
{In our government class we learned about the importance of local government, especially when making an impact on our community. So we thought that meeting with our mayor would be a great opportunity to network in our own community. While meeting with Mayor Sladek, we informed her about what FIRST is all about. We then showed her our robot and explained how it works. And of course, we told her about the outreach we do in our community. Overall, this was a great opportunity to spread the word about FIRST and network with the mayor, who has the biggest impact on our community.
