{Create and develop local connections by volunteering for a greater cause; exemplify FIRST's Core Values within the community} 
On August 5th, 2022, we attended our High Schools Club Crawl. At the event we set up an information booth and an area for the robots to drive around in. We used last year’s robots and thus last year’s game elements along with an improvised goal in the form of a plastic bin. As people, many people were intrigued by our robots running around our improvised field. As more people approached our booth we would present ftc and the FIRST core values; explaining what we do in robotics and what we have done. Many did show a considerable amount of interest: enough to take one of our business cards. This event also adds to our sustainability as it allows us to directly recruit from the Hagerty high school student body.
