{Reaching out and spreading STEM to College students; showing all types of people what the magic of FIRST is and spreading awareness for Robotics. }
{We usually work on our robot over the weekend in the UCF Innovation lab, led by one of our mentors, Don Harper. With new UCF students coming in for the spring semester, the college opened their doors to allow incomers to tour the engineering college at the University. We were offered the chance to be in the Innovation lab as a prime example of its usage, as well as talk about our experiences with the lab. We saw around 30 people that day, and talked to plenty of them, sharing our experiences and supporting one of our most gracious sponsors.
