{Introduce prospective students to Hagerty Robotics and build interest in the program}

For the past couple years, FTC Team 16290 the Z.I.P. Ties has hosted digital interviews called “Z.I.P. Talks.” We had the privilege of being invited into one of these interviews at the beginning of the school year. The subject of our Z.I.P. Talk was preseason developments. What that really means is how our team stays productive over the summer, what we do to teach new members over the summer, changes in game manual 1, game predictions for the season and robot developments. 

Our team stays productive over the summer by participating in other robotics challenges. Most years, that challenge is RoboNation’s RoboBoat challenge (for more information check Notebook entry). 
When it comes to our new members, most of them already have basic knowledge because they came from our sister team, Team 4227, Metal Morphosis. This means that we do not have to teach them much over the summer and are able to focus more on refining skills and teaching incoming members of 4227. We teach these new members through our recruitment camp program which is a week long summercamp at Hagerty High School where we teach new members the basics of FIRST and VEX robotics through presentations and hands on building challenges as well as a custom made robot challenge called Purpole. 

The main game manual change that both us and the Z.I.P. Ties noticed was the change in game manual one for the definition of “launching.” Because of this change we questioned whether or not the season would be a shooting game. This leads perfectly into preseason predictions. For our predictions we looked at the “Leak” that was posted on Reddit, changes in the game manual as well as previous seasons. We noted that previous seasons often follow a trend in hanging where they mostly switch every couple years. Because of that we figured that this season would have a hanging component.

Finally came the discussion of what we have done with our robot. Unfortunately, we have minimal production on our robot for this year because we have been focused on our roboboat season as well as expanding our summer camp programs. Because of this we have excelled in our fundraising but lacked in our development of our hardware. This will be okay in the long run because for whatever robot we design, we will have the proper funding to pay for it.

Overall, the Z.I.P. Talks event was a lot of fun to participate in. We were able to increase communication between teams, spread more about what we do at Hagerty robotics and hopefully reach to a larger audience of FIRST and STEM students.
