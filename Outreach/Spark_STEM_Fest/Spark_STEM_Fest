{To spread STEM and FIRST to the youth in our community.} 
{On February 18th we attended Spark STEM Fest, a STEM festival held annually at the Orlando Science Center. At Spark STEM Fest we connected to hundreds of people and shared the wonders of both STEM and FIRST with them. We had lots of young kids drive our robot and smaller FLL sized robots. It was a great experience because it allowed us to connect with the community and spread robotics. We talked to them about the different things that made FIRST great like teamwork and lots of learning experiences. We were able to Flamespire the kids into becoming interested in STEM and robotics.
