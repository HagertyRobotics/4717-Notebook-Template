{To make a difference in the lives of military families.}
{Operation Paperback is an organization that allows members to collect books and send those books to military families and deployed officers. This outreach was an opportunity that was very meaningful to a couple of our members being part of military families themselves. Being based out of a school, we were able to meet up with our media centerâ€™s staff and were able to organize and take over 500 books from their stock of books that they no longer needed. This meant we had a wide assortment of books to choose from and give to military families. The way that Operation Paperback works is we are given a list of the types and genres of books that they are interested in. We then take this list and choose books that we find that match their genres and we think they might like. This means that if we see a book that we liked we can try to spread that book to more people. From our first group of people, we were able to fill 20 orders and still have left over books to possibly fill out more orders at another date. Though this outreach was not entirely STEM based, it was still a lot of fun to do and it meant a lot to our members that we were able to give back to military families and make such a difference in their lives.
