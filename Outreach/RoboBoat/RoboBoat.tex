{Expand our reach in the robotics community to a new environment; help and mentor teams and provide our knowledge and experience}
{
Following the 2020-2021 FTC Ultimate Goal season, the Mechromancers, as well as various other members from Hagerty Robotics, were thrust into the 2021 RoboBoat Competition, a fresh off-season challenge that allowed the team to expand our sphere of influence in the robotics community to a completely new and exciting environment; the open water. Disjunct from FIRST, the competition assembles high school and college teams from across the world and challenges teams to design, build, program and deploy a fully autonomous boat that can navigate various obstacles and buoys on it's own during a week of competition down in South Daytona. This challenged our veteran leaders, designers and builders and encouraged new ones to help out, and allowed us to introduce FIRST to other teams at the competition, and spread and exemplify its Core Values no matter where we go. Overall, it was an amazing experience; we got 3rd place in Hull Design with a prize of \$300, and the opportunity to spread our team name and the FIRST organization further.
