{To continue growing our skills and spreading FIRST in the local community}
{Over the summer, our team participates in the weeklong, collegiate, international competition, RoboBoat. Through this competition, we grew our connections with the STEM community and increased our technical skills. Our programmers expanded to use Python instead of Java to work with the Robot Operating System (ROS) on Linux and implemented more electronics. Our hardware members elevated their CAD skills by designing a new and improved boat in the shape of a semicircle. This unique design really made us stand out. We placed 5th at RoboBoat.
