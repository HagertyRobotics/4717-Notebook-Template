{To spread STEM and FIRST to the youth in our community.} 
{We were invited to Walker Elementary School to share what we do at Hagerty robotics with one of our local cub scouts packs. We presented our robots from last year, the robot from this year was not in working condition, with the scouts taking great interest. They were intrigued by the various mechanisms on the robots and soon they would be able to get hands-on experience with how the robots operate. We set up 3 tables. One where they built catapults with popsicle sticks, rubber bands and a spoon; one where they built a small paper helicopter and got coloring sheets; and the last one was where the cub scouts got hands on experience with driving our robots from last year along with the spare EV3s that we had lying around.
