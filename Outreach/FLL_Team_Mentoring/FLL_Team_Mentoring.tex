{We have three student-led FLL Challenge teams in our Junior Robotics program here at Hagerty High School. During this robotics season, we have witnessed each member thrive and grow in their knowledge of STEM. The most important lessons we teach them come from our collective knowledge of FIRST and STEM. A lot of us mentors started our journey in FIRST LEGO League as elementary and middle school students. Watching them start their journey is a reminder to us of the impact we can make on our members. We teach the FIRST essentials, such as core values, gracious professionalism, the design process, and team building. We teach core values and gracious professionalism throughout the year but we like to do so in a way that the kids will really learn what it all means. For example, we play telephone to show them how words can change without the crucial element of communication. In addition, we go through a thorough lesson about different robot parts and how they interact. For example, we taught about how gears mesh and can change direction. We teach about the design process and where they collaboratively design a robot, and teach them about specific lessons such as the importance of failure and using it as an advantage.
