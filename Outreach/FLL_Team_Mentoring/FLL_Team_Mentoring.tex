Following our Kids' Summer Camp back in July, one parent reached out to the Mechromancers to facilitate a mentoring program between our team and a rookie FLL team from Okoee, Team 41406. We were incredibly overjoyed to be presented with this opportunity, and immediately agreed. With our outreach leader Ben Steinebronn leading the project, the Mechromancers met with the team every other Friday after our first meeting on November 30th. After introducing them to their challenge, the Mechromancers taught the young roboticists the essentials to succeed in FIRST, providing them with the skills and discipline required in following the engineering process, as well as imbueing within them FIRST's Core Values and the importance of Gracious Professionalism. We set up a team Band, which not only helped us coordinate our meeting dates but also was essential in capacitating intercommunication amongst team members and inciting an exchange of ideas beyond meeting times. We've ordered FLL kits for the team to have all the equipment necessary to begin work on hardware once they've established what they want to try. So far, we've had three meetings, where the Mechromancers have observed great growth within the students and can't wait to observe how the rest of the season turns out.
