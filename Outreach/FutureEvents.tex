\textbf {\large Upcoming Outreach Plans:}
\newline
Although we've reached out to the community frequently throughout the season to educate and spread the word about STEM and FIRST, teach the younger generation about STEM, as well as to consult and interact real engineers and professionals within the field, we still have plans to attend a lot more outreach events througout the rest of the season and to the end of the year. Below, we've listed all the events we will be attending, participating in, or hosting, along with dates and a short description of the event. 

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{East Lake Elementary - Tues/Thurs} - Members from Hagerty Robotics will attend and mentor students in the STEM and Coding Club as well as the Chess Club on some Tuesdays and Thursdays at East Lake Elementary.
   \item \textbf{STEM Fair: 04/15} - Held at the Stater Studio in Downtown Orlando, the team will be participating in a STEM Fair to get kids and youth involved in STEM.
   \item \textbf{NASA Robotic Mining Competition: 05/14} - The Mechromancers will visit and interact with teams participating in the RMC at the Kennedy Space Center, demonstrating our robot and sharing our love for STEM and FIRST's Core Values.
	\item \textbf{Kids Summer Robotics Camp at Hagerty High: 7/23-7/27} - Hagerty Robotics will continue to host their annual kids summer robotics camp at Hagerty High School, mentoring young students in STEM and the basics of robotics as a way to promote engineering within the future generation. 
	\item \textbf{Engineering Notebook Workshops for Rookie FTC Teams: 7/25-7/26} - Hagerty Robotics will also host their annual engineering notebook workshops this summer, mentoring members from rookie FTC teams in how to write a thorough engineering notebook for the upcoming FTC season as a way to show our coopertition towards other teams in FTC. 
	\item \textbf{Recruitment Camp for Hagerty Robotics: 7/30-8/02} - This summer, the team will also hold a separate recruitment camp at Hagerty Robotics for rising freshmen to learn all about our robotics teams and prepare them for joining the team later within the year. 
\end{itemize}
