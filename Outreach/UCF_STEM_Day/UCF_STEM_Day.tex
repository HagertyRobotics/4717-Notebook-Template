{To spread STEM to the youth in our community}
{UCF Stem day is an event that the University of Central Florida hosts for kids in elementary and middle school. There are various stations where they can learn about science, technology, engineering and math. We reached out to the organizer of this event and we secured a place where we could hold a station about our robots. During the UCF STEM Day, we had two members from our team along with two from our sister team, team 4227 Metal Morphosis, went and presented to over 300 students across Central Florida. We had a place where kids could drive our robots, code EV3 robots and learn about other engineering techniques.
