{Create and develop local connections by volunteering for a greater cause; exemplify FIRST's Core Values within the community} 
{Through our Discover program, we introduce students in kindergarten through second grade to STEM, giving them fun, hands-on activities that allow them to learn and express their creativity. Discover also gives the kids important learning habits like teamwork, problem-solving, and communication. Each week our students are given a topic for what to build out of LEGO Duplo bricks and share their creations, then use hands-on learning to discover new STEM topics. In our other FLL Jr. program, Explore, students in second through fourth grades learn more real-world skills as well as the fundamentals of the engineering process. Fostering communication and teamwork, this program lets the students build and program various projects out of LEGO WeDo parts, while we mentor them to develop their problem-solving skills and creativity further.
