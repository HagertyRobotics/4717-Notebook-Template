{Create and develop local connections by volunteering for a greater cause; exemplify FIRST's Core Values within the community} 
{Our youngest team is our four-member FLL Discover team. These students are new to the world of STEM, and it is our job as mentors to provide them with the guidance necessary for their success in the future. Through the use of Lego bricks and fun activities, they have developed a foundation for understanding the Core Values of FIRST, the Engineering Design Process, and Gracious Professionalism. Although these may be big words for our young students, we ensure that our lesson plans allow the students to have fun while learning many new concepts. Most memorably, we spend the first few minutes of each meeting providing the students with a set of 12 colorful Lego bricks. This activity allows the students to express themselves, but in a way that requires them to think in out-of-the-box ways. They learn to discover new ways to build items like chairs, birds, and bridges under the restriction of just 12 bricks. Another session project that helps the students develop innovation skills is the Explore Building Session conducted after each lesson focusing on a transportation concept. Students are tasked with projects from their notebooks and are encouraged to build the vehicles and buildings they design. Then, following their building period, the students share their creations, often working together to simulate the transportation of cargo and vehicles across the Cargo Connect mat. This activity allows them to experience cooperation in an inclusive team environment, which is a skill that will support them now and in the future.
