This season, the Mechromancers took on one of it's most ambitious outreach projects; both the Mechromancers and our sister team Metal Morphosis organized and established two official FLL Jr. teams consisting of Brownie Girl Scouts from the surrounding community. This was a project that the team had been wanting to pursue since last season, offering a thematic continuity from the team's outreach goals last year to inspire the younger generation to pursue STEM. With our communications leader Jolie Miller heading the project for 4717, the FLL Jr. teams meet every other Friday from 6-8 to collaborate and coalesce ideologically with one main goal in mind; to make Mission Moon a success. Following their introduction to the competition, the team was encouraged to brainstorm innovative ideas, and prototype and test their ideas as they saw fit. These activities were interspersed with other fun STEM activities that acted as breaks for the young minds, while still engaging them with learning. Overall, we're extremely proud of how far the team has come, and as the teams' FLL Jr. Expos approach, we await with excited anticipation to see their progress pays off.
