{To volunteer at different FIRST events put on in our community.} 
{
	With this years outreach goal being all about making connections within our community, the Mechromancers saw the offer of going 
an FLL event held at Seminole Science Charter School and took the chance. This event wasn't a typical outreach event, where we demo off the robots, but helping the event as volunteers, just like the events in FTC. Upon arrival we recieved our roles of how to help out the competition run smoothly. We were field resetters, DJ, Ref, robot inspector, or a Judge, or any spot that would be necessary. The Mechromancers were ecstatic to see so many young people in FIRST having a blast. We took any opportunity we could to help mentor the young teams with slight modifications or new ideas the higher level FIRST members. When Towards the end of the day the mentors of the Stingray Cyborgs started to thank us on how much we helped throughout the day and even at the end breaking down the equipment used.
