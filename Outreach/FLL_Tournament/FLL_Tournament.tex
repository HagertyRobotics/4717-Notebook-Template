{To volunteer at different FIRST events in our community.} 
{One thing we pride ourselves on is our mentoring of FLL teams. We have one FLL Discover team, four FLL Explore teams and three FLL Challenge teams. With FLL Challenge, we have been able to teach these young students how to build and program Lego Mindstorms EV3’s to complete missions on the board. We have three different Challenge teams but unfortunately they were not able to all go to the same FLL qualifier. We had two of our newer Challenge teams, the “WARNELB Bros” and Dino Nuggies go to a qualifier on the same day as an FTC Meet. Because of this we were unable to send team members to their qualifier. Though we did not have members go with them we were able to send one of our mentors, Ms. Po, to go with them to make sure they knew what they had to do and were able to get to the judging room on time. Unfortunately neither of these two Challenge teams were able to move past their qualifying tournament which made us put a lot of hope into our third Challenge team, the Minimancers. Two weeks later we had our second Challenge Qualifier, the Exploding Bacon Qualifier. This qualifier was a very intense tournament because it had a lot of the heavy hitting Challenge Teams like the teams from Jackson Heights Middle School, Teams 920 and 10240. At the end of the tournament it turned out that the Minimancers did not move on either which was quite unfortunate. Though none of our FLL Challenge teams moved on, we have decided to continue having meetings until April. Our reasoning for this was to give the newer Challenge members the ability to learn more about coding and building a sturdy robot in the hopes that next year they will be able to move on and qualify for their Regional Tournament.
