The Mechromancers had a spectacular opportunity to make connections at our first outreach event of the 2018-19 season at the Lucerna Studios STEM Fair, on April 29th, 2018. The team was invited to hold an exhibition at a STEM Fair for the launch of Lucerna Studios, an incredible new start-up with a library of academic VR/AR experiences and games that attempts to conquer kids' fear of learning and STEM through their passion for games. Held in downtown Orlando, we presented alongside our friends over on the FRC Team 1902 Exploding Bacon, demoing with partners in crime Woody and Buzz, our previous seasons robots, to children, parents and entrepreneurs at the event. The air buzzing with energy and conversation, the event was an amazing chance for our team to interact with business professionals in the STEM field as well as visitors, and introduce them to FIRST and the opportunities it provides to youth in terms of making STEM exciting, just as Lucerna Studios hopes to do. Overall, it was a fantastic experience that allowed us to meet our program's outreach goals for the year and develop local connections with those in our area.
