{Introduce prospective students to Hagerty Robotics and build interest in the program} 
{
During the 6-8 camp, hosted at Hagerty High School we focused on sharing the power of FIRST with students soon to go into high school. This event provides them with basic programming and mechanical skills. A major portion was also team building, at this event, we split the kids up into different teams. We hoped that doing so would create a good team-centered environment. Each team was responsible for creating one robot that can complete different missions given to them. The team at the end of the week that gathered the most points from completing these tasks will win. They also had to complete a presentation about the environment. This helped them build up presentation skills preparing them for a successful career in the future. Each day they moved in rotations to experience different fields of robotics, including programming a robot to spell their name, building a wooden dinosaur by following steps provided; which helps them focus on the design process of their robot, working on the robot, and working on their presentations. On the last day, we hosted a banquet and invited their families so they could show off their marvelous work. We served food and held the competition. Then we had each team do their presentation and finally looked at photos. To finish off the event each mentor brought in a goodie for each member of their team to remember their exciting week.
