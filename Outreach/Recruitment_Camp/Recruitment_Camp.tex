{To connect with high schoolers and incoming high schoolers who are interested in joining the team}
{At our Recruitment Camp, we invite prospective team members to get a feel for our team and determine if joining would be a good fit for them. We teach high school students the basics of understanding hardware, 3D modeling, writing and running software, writing engineering notebook entries, designing multimedia projects, and creating successful outreach events. Students get a taste of the FIRST Tech Challenge experience and use the skills they develop from this camp to help our team, our sister team, or another community team they may join.
