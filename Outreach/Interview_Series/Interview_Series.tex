{Connect with industry professionals to learn about getting into STEM fields, especially those associated with aerospace.}

We contacted a variety of industry professionals and reached out for interviews. Some of our guests include John Graves and Krista Shaffer, both of whom work at NASA.

John Graves:
A lot of our members have family who work with NASA. One of our team members had the idea to interview someone from NASA using our personal connections. Thatâ€™s how we met Mr. Graves. Mr. Graves is an engineer who specializes in unmanned aerial vehicles. He collaborates between the fields of aviation and STEM, such as working in projects that involve drones, planes, and helicopters. Interviewing Mr. Graves was an experience that we learned a lot from. He enlightened us with his experiences working in the many projects at NASA. He was able to tell us about the key parts to working with a team as well as management and organization. He also gave us some personal suggestions in how to find a meaningful career and field of interest. 

Krista Shaffer:
After our last interview, we were eager to learn more from professionals who work at NASA. We thought about learning more about project management so we reached out to Krista Shaffer, the project manager for the Mobile Launcher at NASA. She spoke to us about transportation and how she uses the Core Values in her job. Her work with the Mobile Launcher allowed us to see the technical side of things at NASA. Ms. Shaffer showed us pictures and videos of the Mobile Launcher and described their engineering design process. She gave us insight on the key parts of a well-rounded team: communication, organization, and time management. She added additional suggestions about how to get into a field similar to hers.
