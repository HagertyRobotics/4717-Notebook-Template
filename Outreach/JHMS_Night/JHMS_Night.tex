{To volunteer at different FIRST events in our community.} 
{We were given the opportunity to go to a STEM night that our local middle school hosted. There we shared what we do at robotics and FIRST core values to the middle schoolers. Many of these kids end up coming to Hagerty for their highschool years, so we were able to not only show the kids about robotics but encourage them to join our team here at Hagerty. This works as part of both our outreach and our sustainability plan for the team. Even if they donâ€™t join our team, they may join another FTC team, and this grows and promotes FIRST further. 

On November 17th, we were given the opportunity to go to a STEM night that our local middle school hosted. There we were able to interact with younger generations and teach them what ftc and FIRST core values are all about. There were also other FTC teams there including Roar Bots and Uplift. With them there we were able to showcase 	our design philosophy which is light and fast robots. We had 	a friendly game of robot tag with Roar bots and our drivetrain allowed us to run circles around them which drew the attention of many of the attendees. We would teach these up and coming members of society the gracious professionalism way and take another step towards spreading the FIRST core values across our community
