{Educate the STEM community on CAD and programming skills for free.}

Over the summer we made an ambitious goal to expand our presence in the world of stem. Although we work extensively within our local communities to personally connect with young and aspiring STEM leaders as well as enthusiasts and engineers at any age, we wanted to make a more widespread effort to share our passion and expertise with a worldwide audience. To achieve this we created 2 video series in which we share our Advanced Knowledge of onshape part studios and assemblies as well as holding livestreams with STEM professionals. These series, comprising over ten videos and livestreams, have been used to grow peopleâ€™s knowledge and interest in computer aided design and industry engineering processes. We found lots of enjoyment sharing this knowledge and we are proud of how we have been able to expand our reach to a larger community.
