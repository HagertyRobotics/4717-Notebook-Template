{What happened:
In the Mechromancersâ€™ first meet of the season, we ranked in 5th place, and had a score of 4 wins and 2 losses of the 6 matches that were played. We encountered several problems that hindered our performance, and found difficulties that we will need to address before the next match. The main problems we faced during this meet were based on software issues as well as the lack of driver practice. For example, in two or three matches, after the end of the autonomous period, the driver station would continuously restart. Such limiting factors were amplified by the changes made to the robot the day before the meet, such as autonomous programming, which left much of the software untested and unresolved and forcing the programmers to work during the meet as well. 

Overall, we were proud of our performance, but we realize that there is still much room to improve, which we will take into consideration to evolve and become better for the second meet on December 9th at Viera High School.

  \begin{itemize}
      \item Test software changes multiple times before matches; don't make sudden changes to the program before a match without testing
      \item Leave a full week after hardware and software changes for realistic and thorough driver practice to prepare drivers completely for the competition
      \item Practice the transition between the autonomous and teleop period 
      \item Keep multiple RC and DS phones fully charged for the day of the competition
      \item Keep some essential tools from the pits in a portable case along with the pits checklist 
      \item Test TeleOp while cuing for matches to ensure that everything is running smoothly
