\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today, we played basketball. 5 to 5 with Annika, Lilly, Ritam, Samantha, Jensen on one side and Rose, Falon, Clayton, Calvin, Nathan on the other. We played at the Live Oak Courts. We brought cookies and Gatorade for everyone and a ball to sign after the game. It was so much fun and I think everyone there had a great time. Unfortunately due to conflicting events and schedules two members were not available, despite that we all had a great game.  We might not be the best at basketball and much less aware of its rules or gameplay, but we definitely enjoyed ourselves and broke a sweat for a game with competitive players and great sportsmanship. However, we had to stop halfway as it did rain at around 6:30ish and it started to lightning and thunder. We hope to meet again to finish our match.
