\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
In this quick meeting, we got all of the pieces ready to assemble the ackermann steering prototype. Before we could start putting the pieces together, though, we noticed a simple, yet important mistake in the design. The main chassis connector piece, central to the entire design was printed at the slightly wrong size due to an error when importing the part into a slicer (figure 1). Luckily, we were able to catch the error, reslice, and reprint the design before the meeting was over. With the new part, we put all of the pieces together, carefully securing all of the turning joints with screws and washers. The final design (figure 2) moved just as we had intended, with the outside knuckle always turning less than the inside knuckle thanks to the angle of the steering arm and the tie bar connector. Feeling successful, we adjourned the meeting, hoping to review the design with one of our mentors at the next meeting.
