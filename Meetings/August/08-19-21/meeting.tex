\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
During today's meeting, we individually added information to our team member takeover sheet. Team takeovers are where we have a member of 4717 "take over" the Instagram page, making educational posts and interacting with followers. We plan to have each of team members take place in one takeover through the course of this season. This is helpful as it will help us get our team name out there and show that we will be ready for the season.
