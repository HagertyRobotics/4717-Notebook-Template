\subsection*{Accomplishments}
During today's meeting we began the programming process for the Mecanum drivetrain. This allowed us to see where hardware can improve and allowed software to get a headstart before the season began. Overall, this meeting was fairly successful and has allowed us to learn a lot about our robot and where to improve.
