\subsection*{Accomplishments}
During this meeting we set up goals for the beginning of the season, began cutting parts for adding on the control hub and battery, and we began programming a tele-op program. The cutting allowed use to have parts ready to assemble our robot. The programming will set us up for better driving and more time to work in the future. The goal planning encouraged backwards planning and how we need to move forwards.

To keep the team up to date we started the meeting with a review of the rev hub holder design. We began the construction of it today; we cut with the glowforge. The glowforge is slow so in the meantime we did a mini cad lesson to newer members. We started covering basic sketch and extrude tools, then advanced to the chamfer and fillet tools. As a test we had them attempt to sketch the first letter of their first name and scaffolded their learning
