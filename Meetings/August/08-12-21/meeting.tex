\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
We started off this meeting with an icebreaker between all of the members of the program. We randomly split into 6 smaller groups, and although we started with the task of describing our favorite color without saying it, every one continued to socialize after completing the task. This gave some of the older members the chance to get a sense of how the new members interact and what they want to learn in the upcoming year. This also gave new members the opportunity to get some more insight into our program. Overall, this hopefully is a sign of more coherent communication and more comfortable interaction in the future.
After the icebreaker, we split all of the newer members into FTC or VEX. Once gathering them into their teams we brought down our new mecanum drivetrain to show to the new members. We explained to them that in FTC, we can use more different materials, showing the wood and 3d printed pulleys on our drivetrain. We also told them about how we utilize more cad and create lots of custom parts for our robot because of this freedom in material use. We then answered various questions about CAD, how mecanum works, and more.
One thing we made sure to mention was that in our FTC program, multimedia and outreach are much more important than in VEX. Some of our multimedia committee members explained what types of multimedia projects we do and why they are important. We want to ensure that the new members know that all skills, robot related or not, have an important and valued place in FTC. One of the other valued things on our team's outreach which we encouraged all of the new members to participate in in the future.
Finally, we ended the meeting by showing new members how to get an Onshape account so they can start learning as soon as possible. We look forward to working in tandem with 4227, the rookie team that all of the new members will be joining this season.
