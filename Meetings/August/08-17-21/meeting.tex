\subsection*{Accomplishments}
During our meeting, we began by taking time to celebrate Nathan's blueday (A made up holiday to support the fact that Nathan enjoys the color blue). We had blue cake with blue frosting and gave him blue colored gifts. After that we discussed any group updates and possible tasks to do. We then cut out parts and wrote out our names so we can do the team member takeovers. This was the perfect way to party now that we were in person.
