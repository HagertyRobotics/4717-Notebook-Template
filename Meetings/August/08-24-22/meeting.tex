\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today was the second program meeting, where all Hagerty Robotics teams meet together for general announcements. In the last meeting, we got acquainted with our new members, and they got acquainted with the teams, as well as joining our Band and Discord servers for communication purposes. Today we finished up that last point, getting all members into our servers and confirming they were there. This will be essential for their communication within their teams. As the veteran team, it was nice to help a fellow robotics member, and we hope to do so more in the future.

The new members were given information on dues, purchasing polos for usage in our uniforms, and a history of our program. They were also introduced to both VEX and FTC, since we have teams for both organizations. They had time to speak with all existing members of the programs, and naturally, we were the ones to explain FTC to them. We managed to recruit some people, in particular a few with uncommon skills, such as metalworking and art, which will be very useful in hardware and multimedia respectively. Considering they stay, we should see some useful new members come in next season.

The future is bright for the program this season, with many new members and interest as high as ever. We're excited to see them grow and learn, and hopefully help them do that ourselves along the way.
