\subsection*{Accomplishments}
Today, Falon and Rose worked on the Team Takeover Photoshop document. We spent the meeting adding new photos and editing them, as well as writing captions for each one. We have finished Jensen and Nathan's photos, but need photos for many of the other members. The Multimedia Committee will continue with this during the next meeting, and hopefully be able to finish more Team Takeover folders for members of our team.
