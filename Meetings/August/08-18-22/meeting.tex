\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
We began by reintroducing ourselves as it had been a while and some of us had not seen each other in a while. We then went over committees, which we sign up for based on personal interest and are free to change during the year. This is so we can stay organized and have a better idea of what we will be doing during the year. Before the season started, all members filled out a google from which included which committees they would like to be in, which committees they would like to make minor contributions to, and an overall ranking of each committee. 

Knowing which roles each of us were in, we discussed the responsibilities of each committee (Figure 1), such that we would know exactly what our jobs are entering the new season. We then went broader and discussed the goals of the team and each committee, such as improving communication by adding a updates channel to our discord, our primary form of communication between members. The updates channel would act as a sort of mini notebook with footnotes of what members have accomplished. We came up with that idea because our rookie team, 4227, had an updates channel which was helpful, but was not used to it's fullest potential. We saw the opportunity here, so we wish to expand upon this, by having all of our members use it more consistently since our discord server is more active than 4227.

Alongside assessing the future, we also assessed the past. We use a self review system called a SWOT analysis, standing for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. In the previously mentioned google form, we submitted entries for each of these categories. We ended up with Team Cohesion,  Synergy, and Out-of-The-Box Thinking for Strengths. For Weaknesses, we had Fewer Multimedia and Communications Persons. For Opportunities, we have Access to UCF and STEM Professionals. Lastly, for Threats we have a Lack of Unique Outreach Abilities and a Lack of Multimedia skills. We hope to address our Weaknesses and Threats in the future. Part of addressing the mentioned ones involves our Multimedia, Communications and Outreach committees, who will likely be able to address this.

Going into the new season, it's important we understand each other. As such, in the google form we had everybody take the Myers Briggs personality test, which tells your personality based on a 100 question questionnaire, and gives your personality as a four letter label. We do this to better know each other, and how we act, that way we can better expect how we interact with certain situations. From our survey we found that 4717 consists primarily of Introverts, which was expected to say the least. Hopefully this can assist with our synergy in the future.

We finished off by talking about team building activities. We're all friends with each other, and we love doing things outside of a robotics as a team. Last year we all played basketball together, and we would like to do more things like that in the future.
