\subsection*{Accomplishments}
Today we worked on the 3rd slide of the Team Takeover social media templates. Falon and Samantha worked together to brainstorm some ideas for graphic design features, and then put them into effect. Through trial and error, they worked through the meeting trying to make different aspects symmetrical or ensure they were shaded correctly. They also installed fairy lights under the kitchen cabinets in the robotics room.
