\subsection*{Accomplishments}
We decided the controller layout for the drive train. On the left stick, forward and back moves the robot forwards and backwards, while left turns the robot left and right turn the robot right. Even further, we tried to implement vector tracking by utlizing the position of the joystick as a vector, and this would then give us the direction we wanted to go in our robot. This was however quite tedious and we were not able to figure it out in time. Our next steps are to figure out a way to implement Mecanum drive with x, y positions from our joysticks.
