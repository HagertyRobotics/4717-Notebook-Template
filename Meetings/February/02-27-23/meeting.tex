\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
On Monday, we began our final preparations for the States competition coming up this Saturday, primarily focussing on Presentation, which is Tuesday. We started by discussing all the non-robot tasks that we needed to complete this week, as well as decided who would take the lead on each task. Several members made a list of supplies to order for our pit at States. At 3:15 and 4:00, we did run-throughs of tomorrowâ€™s presentation in order to work out the kinks and know our parts well enough to present smoothly and within the time frame. At 4:30, we participated in a Zoom meeting with Mr.Teter who listened to our presentation and gave us some insightful advice.
