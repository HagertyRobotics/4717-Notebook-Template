\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today, we worked on implementing a software differential for a robotic system with two wheels that need to rotate at different speeds to turn smoothly and accurately. We wrote a function to calculate the difference between the desired speeds of the wheels and used it to determine the amount of torque to be applied to each wheel. We faced some difficulty 

\whatsnext{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continue working on differential
\end{itemize}
