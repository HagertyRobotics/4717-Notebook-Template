\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today we hit a major milestone with our car drivetrain as we drove it around the field for the first time. We had a lot of fun driving it, as it controls very differently to any other robot weâ€™ve ever seen (figure 1). As the name suggests, it drives more like a car because of its front wheel turning. Despite being very different, controlling the robot started to feel pretty natural as we practiced making cycles. Even without any arm or other mechanism attached, we found that we could drive as fast as the tank drivetrain, and with a little practice, we could be moving extremely quickly. We all were in agreement that this drivetrain has a lot more potential for speed than the tank drive does. With all of this in mind, we decided to continue working with this 3- wheeled car drivetrain, giving hardware the task of designing a 3d printed version.

Next, we needed a model of the Banebots gearbox in order to get the hole pattern. We made a motor assembly containing the gearbox, motor, and key as shown in Figure \ref{fig:banemod}. From there, we were able to create the motor plate part.

In order to inherit the plate outline from the drive train skeleton, we performed the Copy Geometry operation, making the sketch and axises references embedded within the motor plate as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ext_mot}. From those references, we made an extrude for the plate, cutouts for the two motors to go into (Figure \ref{fig:motcutout}) and the slots for tensioning (Figure \ref{fig:slotten}). The two diagonal holes for the motor are larger than the other diagonal two because we wanted to be able to remove the motor from the plate without disassembling the gearbox form the motor (we are using the gearbox screws to mount the motor to the plate). As a result, two screws will already be tightened and their heads fit within the clearance holes and two screws will go through the motor plate and into the gearbox threads.
