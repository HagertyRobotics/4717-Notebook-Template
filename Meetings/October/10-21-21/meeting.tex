\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
During today's meeting, we specified the "Thank You" letter template to apply to the 11 different organizations and companies that had provided us with donations in the previous season. Many of these donations included monetary contributions, discounts on products, and free items like software, REV Hubs, batteries, and a TV. The sponsor thank you letters detail how the contributions have benefitted our team, while giving each donor a review of the past season and our achievements. We made sure to include that our team is continuing on in this season of Freight Frenzy, and that their continued support would be greatly appreciated. The team decided that once the letters are printed, that we should sign them by hand, as opposed to making digital signatures. We decided to do this, along with including a group picture of our team, to establish more sentiment with the companies and organizations that have provided us with generosity. By doing so, we hope that our connection with our sponsors will be reinforced, especially after the 2020-2021 season which had taken a toll on our ability to communicate with them.
