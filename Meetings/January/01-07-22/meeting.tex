\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Our task for today was to focus on putting the promote script through grammar checking and time how long it would take to read the script. We did this in order to make sure that we stayed well within the 1 minute time constraint, especially because we would need to include a few seconds of pauses for dramatic effect when the audio was combined with the frames of the animation. After completing this, we combined the storyboard and script, and spent time drawing out a visual storyboard for the animation aspect of the video. We created a Google Slides and put photos of our dry-erase drawings on it, so we could simulate an animation and begin to start drawing frames.
