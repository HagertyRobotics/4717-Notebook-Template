\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Our most recent Space Coast League Meet was Saturday 1/15/22. Because of this, a lot of our team's supplies were on the mentors' cars. Our first priority was moving everything back to the robotics room for use until the League Championships. Because our school is hosting the League championships, we also had to store fields for use on competition day. 

\whatsnext{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prepare to set up fields for League Championships on February 6
\end{itemize}
