\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Our drivetrain this year is really similar to last year. Instead of a tricycle design, it is now an ackerman steering and steers the front two wheels with a servo just like last year. Beause our software laster year was flexible, we were able to use last year's tricycle drive program on our new drivetrain. This allowed us to save time programming whie also allowing new members on our team to learn from our old code. We also pulled in more files from our old code such as examples of teleop and autonomous and adapted them to work with this year's robot. In summary, today was setting up our robot to program.

 

\whatsnext{
\begin{itemize}
    \item program the gamepads to allow us to drive the bot.
