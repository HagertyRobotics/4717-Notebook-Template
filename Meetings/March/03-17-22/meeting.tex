\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today our mentor suggested changing the way we use the PID on the arm. Although our SimpleMovingAverage from last time greatly improved our consistency, we might be able to make it better. Currently, we used a positional PID and adjusting for gravity by subtracing a constant. One suggestion we had was to use a velocity PID
