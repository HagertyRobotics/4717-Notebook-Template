\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
During States Scoopie faced a lot of trail and error. Scoopie had to work with robots with a wider range of skill. However do to Scoopie's quick speed he was able to maneuvered around the larger robots a lot faster. Unlike a majority of the robots that were seen continuously having to stop in order get around the other robots. Do to Scoopie's small size, quick speed and his usage of the side entrances which are often ignored Scoopie performed a lot better than some of the teams with the larger range 
of skill. Scoopie was able to get the range of jobs he could do quick and fast. Overall we were able to make it to our division finals and finally won the Lawrence division!
