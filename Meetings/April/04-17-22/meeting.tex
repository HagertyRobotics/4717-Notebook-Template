\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today, we collaborated inefficiently with Java the Hutts, a fellow FTC team that is going to worlds. During this meeting, we discussed the basics of our trip to worlds including transport, housing, changes in robot, changes in software, communication and outreach, and the basics of our scouting. Overall, the meeting was 20 minutes long and not very insightful however it did raise a bond between the two teams. Hopefully we can communicate more during worlds.
