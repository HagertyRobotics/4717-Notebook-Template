\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
Today we held a team-wide meeting to discuss worlds. First, we checked to ensure that all members submitted travel payments and the required forms to take 4 days off school. Since all the paperwork was finished, we could move onto the next step. We plan to leave on 4/19 and return on 4/24. We plan to be staying at the Mariott Medical Center in Houston. Our team agreed on a dress code and discussed the meal plans for each day we are in Houston. We also received the flight information. We are nervous yet excited to have fun in Houston. We also began writing packing lists, printing out our flyers and other materials, and making buttons. A team member also created Florida-shaped pins using our Glowforge laser cutter to hand out to other teams at Worlds.

\subsubsection*{Accomplishments}
During today's meeting, I was able to cad the new element using the dimensions on the magnets that we ordered yesterday. The magnets are 10mm in diameter and 2 mm tall. For this element, I took our previous working element and added holes for where we intend on placing the magnets. I also added in the team number so we don't have to draw it on. One final modification I made was adding a guide for where we intend to place the carbon fiber rod which will hold up the hoop.
