\subsection*{Accomplishments}
Todays meeting focused on strategy for the future season and what we could do in advance. Last year we had a long and what seemed like endless discussion on what type of drivetrain to use. This heavily delayed our construction progress so this summer we aim to build the drivetrain in advance. Addionally we inventoried what parts we had and what parts we need to build it. We also focused on getting everyones opinions for the upcoming season in open forum style. Then we divided the building the drivetrain of the robot into commitees. Lastly we discussed the use of odometry and after years of having to take apart the whole robot for a tiny change we discussed our goal of designing a robot with an easy assembly - starting with the drivetrain!
