Ms. Miller is our Communications/Engineering Notebook Mentor. This is her ninth year mentoring an FTC team, her second mentoring Hagerty Robotics. Ms. Miller works for the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. With STEM playing an ever increasing role in our everyday lives, Ms. Miller felt it was important to encourage her kids and other youth to participate in FIRST programs. She loves mentoring and learning right alongside the youth. In her free time, Ms. Miller enjoys running, gardening, sewing, and spending time outdoors with her family.
