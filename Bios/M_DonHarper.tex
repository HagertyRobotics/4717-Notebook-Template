Pursuing robotics and engineering as a personal passion and as his profession, Mr. Don Harper is our technical mentor, providing guidance and leadership to the team in software and hardware design. With Mr. Harper around, you will NEVER be bored. He won't let you! Mr. Harper loves challenges, and finding innovative solutions to problems. He is no stranger to robotics competitions. He remodeled his wife's car into an autonomous car, which earned him a spot in the finals of the DARPA Urban Challenge with the lowest budget of the whole competition. He's also been on the BattleBots TV show with his robot, and has been mentoring our team for over 5 years! Besides robotics, one of his favorite hobbies is sailing. As a 16 year old, he sailed a 16-foot catamaran all the way to the Bahamas!
