{  
Tyler is a senior at Hagerty High School, and this is his second year in the Hagerty robotics program. He joined because he likes to better himself and learn how to cooperate with a team. He also enjoys designing things to complete or automate a task and mainly works on the physical hardware aspects and the design process of the robot. Last year he was part of the committee that built a robot that earned a spot to go to states. He wishes to pursue a career in mechanical engineering.
