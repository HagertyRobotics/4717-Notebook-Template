Laura is a sophomore at Hagerty High School. This is her second year in the Hagerty Robotics Program and her fifth year in FIRST. She joined the Hagerty Robotics program because she wanted to continue her journey in robotics and to learn how to cooperate with people with different skills in the team. This year, Laura plans on working with her teammates in different events to help spread FIRST in the community. She wants to pursue a career in either Nursing or Computer Science. Aside from robotics Laura loves playing the viola and reading books during her free time.
