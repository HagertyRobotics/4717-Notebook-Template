Stefan Ibarguen is a mentor for the Hagerty Robotics Program.  He started as a mentor with Hagerty Robotics in 2013 when teaching AP Computer Science and Robotics classes at our school.  He is no longer teaching classes, but continues as a mentor for the program because it is the most rewarding part of working at Hagerty High School.  The challenge of trying to bring order to the natural chaos of a group of highly talented high school teenagers is one that he relishes.  Before coming to Hagerty, Mr. Ibarguen spent many years at the Veritas corporation working in software development.  \\
