Jensen is a sophomore at Hagerty High School. This is his second year in FTC and his fourth year participating in FIRST. He joined the team because he is interested in building, designing, and bettering himself by expanding his STEAM knowledge. This season, Jensen is looking forward to increasing his hardware, CAD, and multimedia skills and assisting the Mechromancers with their FIRST Innovation Project. His favorite food is dumplings and he can frequently be found watching Community. Outside of robotics, Jensen enjoys spending his time outdoors, hiking, camping, canoeing, and exploring nature.
