Nathan is a senior at Hagerty High School. This is his fourth year in FTC and his sixth in First. After doing FLL for two years in middle school, he wanted to join FTC to learn more complex hardware and to learn how to use CAD. Since becoming a part of FTC, he has explored his interests in engineering, learning how to build pieces of the robot and design new parts in CAD. In addition, FTC has allowed him to discover new passions in working with the multimedia committee to re-brand the team and create videos as well as with the outreach committee, especially in mentoring the Hagerty robotics FLL challenge teams. This year, Nathan looks forward to expanding his knowledge of hardware and technical writing, as well as continuing to mentor FLL challenge teams. Outside of robotics he enjoys 3D modeling and art and wants to go into a career in mechanical engineering or science.
