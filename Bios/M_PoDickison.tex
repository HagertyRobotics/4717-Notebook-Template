Po Dickison is a wonderful mentor. Mrs. Dickison works as the Media Specialist for Hagerty High School. She has over 18 years of experience in education and is passionate about STEM technology and learning. In addition to her Media position, Mrs. Dickison sponsors the Hagerty Robotics Program and the Future Educators of America Honor Society. She has presented at State and National level Technology conferences. In her spare time, she likes to read, shop, spend time with her family, and travel; however, due to her dedication to robotics, we make sure she has little spare time. We really love her, and she rakes in the cash for Hagerty Robotics. Without her, the teams’ robots would be made of duct tape and zip-ties. “I’m coaching Hagerty Robotics because I really want kids to go into the STEM field, it’s something that’s becoming the future.”  \\
