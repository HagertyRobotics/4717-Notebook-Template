Lilly is a Senior here at Hagerty High. This is her fourth year in the Hagerty Robotics program. She joined the robotics team because she loves all sciences and mathematics, but most of all she is excited to learn programming and technical skills. Considering a science centered field, Lilly feels this program could broaden her expertises and overall aid in developing a thorough understanding of new technology. After school she loves to swim, play classical piano, and cook. She is ecstatic for this year and is ready to learn, be challenged, and excel! GO HUSKIES!!!!!
