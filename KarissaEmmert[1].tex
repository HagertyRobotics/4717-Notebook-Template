Karissa is a sophomore at Hagerty High School and this is her second year with the Hagerty robotics program and her sixth year in FIRST. She joined the Hagerty Robotics program because she wanted to become more skilled in computer programming and to develop her ability to communicate and work in a team. This season, Karissa looks forward to expanding her knowledge in technical writing, so she can help the team put together an organized, professional-looking Engineering Notebook. She would also like to learn more about CADing. Karissa is passionate about science, and hopes to pursue a career in biology, possibly in ecology or evolutionary biology. Outside of robotics, Karissa enjoys reading books, fishing, hiking, kayaking, and spending time in nature.
