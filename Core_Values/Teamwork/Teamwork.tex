{When the whole team comes together, anything is possible. I love that.}{Lillian Sullivan, 9}
{Teamwork lies at the heart of every loyal Mechromancer. Team unity is something we struggle with at times, due to members being so different, but it is a challenge we have actively worked to overcome. Using a communication app called Band, as well as a business management app called Trello, we work to remain united and merged in team spirit. Mechromancers Rise! }
