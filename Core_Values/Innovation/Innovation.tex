{Due to its intriguing design, our robot, Bullseye, tends to turn a few heads. The first thing an individual notices when they see Bullseye is it’s big wheels. The reason behind this unusual choice is the innovative opportunities it provided, as well as its potential efficiency. Our drivetrain is like no other team we’ve ever encountered, and our free floating chassis are just some of the ways we innovate as we design.}
