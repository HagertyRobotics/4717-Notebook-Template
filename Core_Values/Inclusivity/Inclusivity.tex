{Everyone has a duty and responsibility on the team, and I think that's what makes us special}{Haven Carter, 12}
{As a practically ancient team, Mechromancers have grown over the years to include people from different walks of life. We began as an all girls team called Estrogenius, and over the years, we’ve risen anew to include a variety of genders, ethnicities, countries of origin, and skills on our team. It’s incredibly important to us that we maintain diversity and positivity in everything we do. We also strive to include every team member in all parts of robotics especially the freshman students. By the end of the build season, us members are practically family.}
