{The Mechromancers are like my second family. Sure, we work together, but we also have fun together.}{Jolie Miller, 10}
{While some may assume Mechromancers are all work and no play, they will soon find a much more lighthearted side to this sinister squad. We find delight in the innovation and discovery opportunities we gain everyday through our program. It might be a little cliche, but we couldn’t love our team more. As they say, FIRST is the hardest fun we’ll ever have.}
