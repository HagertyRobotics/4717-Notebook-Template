{Every day I walk into the robotics room, I get to learn new concepts and apply old ones I'd only ever been lectured about.}{Mason Dettman, 11}
{Us Mechromancers love to learn new things, and each of our members comes in everyday with a ready mind set. Our team shows discovery through our pursuit of knowledge. For example, at one meeting we asked an engineer to come in and teach our team how to solder. We also discovered a lot through our unique drivetrain design. By having an unusual design, our team gained insightful knowledge of physics and gyros. }
